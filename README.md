# Student-Grievance-System

•This project was created for the Institution to manage the complaints filed by the Students.

•In college if anyone wants to raise a complaint then one has to write on a paper and wait for the respond to whom it’s
addressed.

• Student has to sign up/log in and complain about the issues he finds.

• Admin has to log in through his login ID and can view the complaints that the students have raised.

• Based on the categories Admin can filter the complaints at the Department level Or Institute Level.

• Later, the Admin can sort complaints based on some priorities or keywords.

• In this system, the admin can view the complaint details and take further actions required accordingly. Each complaint
will have a definite time limit associated with it. 

• The student gets the notification whether the complaint is IN PROCESS or it has been CLOSED by the Admin ON
Dashboard.

• Student needs to check the complaint status whereas Admin needs to check the complaint regularly to see whether new
complaint has been filed or not.
